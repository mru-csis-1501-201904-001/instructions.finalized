# LAB QUIZ 02 - GETTING STARTED

1. Start Eclipse; it takes a while to roll.
1. Open a web browser.
1. Go to the GitHub Classroom URL for your lab:
  - group-1 (section 501): http://bit.ly/2iVXEqH
  - group-2 (section 502): http://bit.ly/2niWZAE
  - group-3 (section 505): http://bit.ly/2VbXcnC
1. Follow the procedure we covered in lab or that you saw in [this video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PJbZtRAYg5U7Q_kVic25-G3x87u7WsWS) to download the starting project for the quiz.
   - Keep the resulting webpage open - you'll need it to view the quiz instructions and later to submit your quiz.
1. Import the `lab-quiz-02-<username>-master` directory into your Eclipse Workspace.
1. The instructions for the test itself will be in the browser; look for `quiz-02-instructions.md`.
