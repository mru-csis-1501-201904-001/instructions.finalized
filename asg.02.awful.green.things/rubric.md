# Assignment 02 Rubric

Code is not only meant to be **run**; it's also meant to be **read**. As such, I consider it equally important that your code _does what it's supposed to do_ **AND** _be easy to read and understand_. The marking scheme reflects this.

An assignment is also an excellent opportunity to open up a conversation between a reader of the code (that's me) and the writer of the code (that's you). Getting feedback about what you've created - both the "good" and the "needs work" part - is super important. As such, instead of providing some quick cookie-cutter comments, I am willing (and eager!) to sit down with each student and go over their code with them. So if you want to have that conversation - and I hope you do - please contact me in person or by email after you get your marks back and we'll arrange a mutually-acceptable time when we can talk about your code.

## The Awful Green Things from Outer Space Challenge

### Grade Levels

#### A Level

To get an A-, you need to have both the MonsterReader and MonsterWriter classes passing all tests.

To get an A, in addition to the A- requirements, you also need to then have the other 2 classes passing all tests.

An A+ is everything at the A level, plus your code is just plain _noice_ - it follows all design guidelines and is a pleasure to read.

#### B Level

Phase 2 is completed: you've submitted all 6 source files outlined in the Phase Two instructions and they all compile. You may have some small deviations from the design guidelines, but overall, you're following them.

You should have one test class for each of the 2 classes **you've** created; each tests class must contain 2 associated @Test methods that are both passing.

#### C Level

Phase 1 is completed: you've submitted all 4 source files outlined in the Phase One instructions and it all compiles. You may have some small deviations from the design guidelines, but overall, you're following them.

You should have one test class for each of the 4 classes; each tests class must contain 2 associated @Test methods that are both passing.

#### D Level

Phase 1 is partially completed: you've submitted source files for some or all of the 4 required classes outlined in the Phase One instructions. This code shows a borderline grasp of the concepts we have covered in the course so far: perhaps it doesn't compile, or it shows frequent deviations from the design guidelines.

You should have at least two test classes with associated @Test methods (2 for each class) that are all passing.

#### F Level

No submission, or the submitted work shows a marked lack of understanding the basic concepts covered in this course.
