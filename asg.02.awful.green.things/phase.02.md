# Phase Two

## PREAMBLE

Now that you've had some fun (?) making your own classes, we're going to reign that in a bit. And then open it up again.

**You are only allowed to start phase two if you've submitted phase one AND I've emailed you back with the repo link for phase two!**

There will be one more phase after this one; phase three will have you:

- modify the `Weapon` and `WeaponFactory` classes you create in phase two,
- create two classes that do file reading and writing according to spec, and
- do some creative work that can earn you some bonus points

## DELIVERABLES

You will need to revise some of the classes you created in phase one, create two classes according to specs I provide, and then get creative with another two classes and design them yourself:

#### REVISIONS

- [ ] modify your `Monster` class based on my starting version; it must pass all the tests I provide
- [ ] modify your `DiceUtil`; it must pass all the tests I provide

#### ACCORDING-TO-SPECS

- [ ] complete a `MonsterFactory` class which passes all the tests I provide
- [ ] complete a `Monsters` class which passes all the tests I provide

#### CREATIVE TIME

- [ ] complete a `Weapon` class, along with 2 tests
- [ ] complete a `WeaponFactory` class, along with 2 tests. Base it on your work with `MonsterFactory`.

## ADDITIONAL SPEC INFO

Additional spec info will be found in the starting project for phase two. So you won't see it until you finish phase one!
