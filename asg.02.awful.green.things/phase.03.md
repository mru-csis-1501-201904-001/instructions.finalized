# Phase Three

## PREAMBLE

This is it - the final push.

**You are only allowed to start phase three if you've submitted phase one and phase two AND I've emailed you back with the repo link for phase three!**

## DELIVERABLES

You will need to revise some of the classes you created in phase two, create two classes according to specs I provide, and then get creative with another two classes and design them yourself:

#### REVISIONS

- [ ] modify your `Weapon` class based on my starting version; it must pass all the tests I provide
- [ ] modify your `WeaponFactory` class based on my starting version; it must pass all the tests I provide

#### ACCORDING-TO-SPECS

- [ ] complete a `MonsterReader` class which passes all the tests I provide
- [ ] complete a `MonsterWriter` class which passes all the tests I provide

Please look at the [file format details](JAML.details.md) for the files you'll be reading from and writing to.

#### CREATIVE TIME

If you have some free time left - and energy - you can do some additional tasks to gain a bit of a bonus: I will weight your lowest lab quiz 2% and your highest lab quiz 6%. Your lowest lab quiz **cannot** be a F - to put it another way, I will only modify a quiz that was actually written!

**You will only get the bonus if you complete the other classes required in this phase.**

Here are some examples of things you could do:

- [ ] make a new type of Weapon, including icon, that works in the game
- [ ] make a new type of Monster, including icon, that works in the game
- [ ] make modifications to the AI class so that the game behaves in a different manner; you have to clear your modification with me first so I can evaluate whether it's "meaty" enough to warrant the bonus reward

If you have any other ideas, come and talk to me and I'll consider it!

## ADDITIONAL SPEC INFO

Additional spec info will be found in the starting project for phase three. So you won't see it until you finish phase two!
