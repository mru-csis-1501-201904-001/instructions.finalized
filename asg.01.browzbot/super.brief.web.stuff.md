# Super Brief Web Stuff

**WARNING**

_Don't worry about this stuff until you have completed the BrowserAutomationApp class; otherwise, you're just going to be distracted._

A user wishing to issue instructions to a Browzbot needs to know a little bit about the underlying structure of web pages; in particular, about `elements`, `ids`, and `classes`.

Instead of just barfing definitions at you, let's just futz around with the finished app and let these concepts come naturally. Very Zen, baby.

I've got a screencast where I walk through playing around with a finished application so you can see what you need to do to actually drive your application properly. It's a surprising amount of work just to do little thing...it might give you some appreciation for how much is going on behind the scenes of the webpages you use every day!

The screencast is [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19hP_gPAn6FP2T7qvVNHnXUyGhk93TXv8).
